ASCII 2.0 ToDo
==============

Project notes by D.J. van Enckevort

Functions to implement
----------------------
+ Hiding of MLE to save real estate
  User can check MLE in the Edit menu to show the MLE on top of the table or
  uncheck it to hide it. If the MLE is hidden the copy, cut, paste and clear
  items in the edit menu should be disabled and the table should be resized to
  use all available space. This means the sizing and moving functions need to
  be rewritten too!
+ Reduced table
  User can select a starting and an ending character for the table, and the
  program will remove the unneeded rows in the table to save some space. Note
  that this means that the fly-over alt-nnn info is calculated by based on the
  number of colums and rows, this function must be adjusted in order to give
  the correct information. The same for the input of the character????
+ DirectType
  The character the user selects in the table is sent directly to another
  application. The user selects the application upon activation of DirectType
  from a window.
+ Type2Clipboard
  The character the user selects in the table is automatically copied to the
  clipboard, so it is easy to paste the character into another application.
  (Useful for applications that don't work with DirectType or if you only want
  to type an occasional character with ASCII Table.
+ Help
  Context sensitive online help. A draft of a help file is already available,
  however the functionality is still completely lacking from the program. Need
  to review all windows and messageboxes.
+ Printing
  Possibility to print the table.
+ Documentation
  Documentation should cover the newly to implement functions like DirectType
  and Type2Clipboard.

Bugs to solve
-------------
None

Cleaning up etc.
----------------
+ Main Window Procedure is far to large, have to split it up into several
  functions:
  + DirectType
  + FontDialog
  + Init
  + ....
+ Other Window Procedures should be in separate files
  + about.c: AboutProc
  + dtype.c: DirectTypeProc and functions relative to DirectType
  + settings.c: SettingsProc and functions relative to settings (also loading
    from INI?)
  + font.c: Font and codepage stuff
+ What is saved to the INI file should be reviewed, probably is more than I
  need to know
+ Program should be thoroughly documented
+ Program should get a new icon, and all windows should use it in the system
  menu. Also the about window should have an icon or a bitmap. (But who is
  going to create one)
+ Get all strings out of the program into the resources. (Eases localization)
